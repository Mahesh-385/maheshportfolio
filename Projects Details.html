    <h2>Description:</h2>
    <blockquote>A database-management system (DBMS) is a collection of interrelated data and a set of programs to access those data. The 
        database contains information relevant to an enterprise. The primary goal of a DBMS is to provide a way to store and retrieve 
        database information that is both convenient and efficient. By data, we mean known facts that can be recorded and that have 
        implicit meaning. A datum – a unit of data – is a symbol or a set of symbols which is used to represent something. This 
        relationship between symbols and what they represent is the essence of what we mean by information. Hence, information is 
        interpreted data – data supplied with semantics. Knowledge refers to the practical use of information. While information can 
        be transported, stored or shared without many difficulties the same cannot be said about knowledge. Knowledge necessarily 
        involves a personal experience. Database systems are designed to manage large bodies of information. Management of data 
        involves both defining structures for storage of information and providing mechanisms for the manipulation of information. 
        In addition, the database system must ensure the safety of the information stored, despite system crashes or attempts at 
        unauthorized access. If data are to be shared among several users, the system must avoid possible anomalous results. 
        Because information is so important in most organizations, computer scientists have developed a large body of concepts and 
        techniques for managing data</blockquote>
